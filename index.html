		<p>I love to build things for the web. Coming up with implementations for ideas and little projects is something that I do alot in my free time. I'm always on the lookout for a cool sideproject that I can turn into code. Most of the time the planning and designing the architecture is the biggest part of coming up with ideas, because I like to think stuff through before building, but sometimes you just have to start building and get going.</p>
		<blockquote>"Done is better than perfect!"</blockquote>
		<p>To make it easy for me to start I try to keep my tech stack compact and tend to focus on fewer technologies that I can learn to their fullest potential. For my most recent projects that has been Symfony/Laravel for backend side of things, because I use this stack at my full-time position right now and ReactJS on the frontend coupled with an SQL database. I've also started to get to know CI tools like Github Actions/Gitlab CI and Circle CI</p>

		</div>

		<p class="project-description">Paper Hands is a paper trade web application, that simulates buying stocks. You can register, login and manage your portfolio by buying and sell stocks.</p>
		<p class="project-description">It integrates with a third-party API to get the current stockprices at the moment of every buy/sell operation in the backend and automatically updates your Account Balance accordingly. It also features API endpoints itself to buy/sell.</p>
		<p class="project-description">The application was built as a proof-of-concept and could be expanded by a graphical representation of the current stock prices, functioning authentication for the API (right now only frontend authentication is implemented), and definitely a whole lot of other features, but I was satisfied with it as a weekend project.</p>
		<p>PHP - Symfony - Twig - CSS - SQL</p>
